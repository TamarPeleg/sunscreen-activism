<button type="button" class="collapsible">Chemical vs. Physical Sunscreen: what's the difference? </button>
<div class="content">

  <p> Sunscreen helps protect your skin cells from exposure to the sun’s damaging rays (Ultraviolent or UV rays).</p>
  <p> There are 2 types of broad-spectrum (protecting from UVA and UVB rays emitted from the sun): chemical sunscreens, also known as organic (carbon-based) sunscreen, and physical sunscreen, also known as mineral or nonorganic sunscreen. </p> <br> </br>
  <h4> So what's the difference between the two?</h4> 
  <br> </br>
  <p> The key difference lies in the mechanism of sun protection. Physical sunscreens create a layer of protection on the surface of your skin and act as a shield, while chemical sunscreens sink into your skin and act more like a sponge, absorbing the UV rays and emitting them as non-harmful heat. </p> 
  <br> </br>
  <h4> Physical (mineral) sunscreen </h4>
  <p> Physical sunscreens create a physical barrier on the skin that shields it from the sun’s rays: delivering broad-spectrum protection (against both UVA and UVB rays) by reflecting UV radiation away from your skin. The two ingredients that are found in mineral sunscreens are zinc oxide and titanium oxide, both anorganic compounds. </p> <br> </br>
  <h4> Chemical sunscreen </h4>
  <p> Chemical sunscreens contain active ingredients that absorb UV rays before they damage skin cells. Those UV filtering ingredients are oxybenzone, avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate, and octinoxate. The advantage of chemical sunscreen that appeals to many individuals is its ability to easily rub into the skin, and don't leave a strong white cast that many mineral sunscreen with old forumulation do (formulas have been improved and it's not as big of an issue nowadays). However, the UV filtering ingredients that absorb so well may pose health concerns, and their satefy is still debated. 
<p>A 2020 study found that many of the active ingredients currently under study by the FDA enter the bloodstream after just one application. These ingredients remain detectable in the blood and on the skin up to 3 weeks later — at concentrations passing the threshold where the FDA considered waiving additional safety trials. </p>
<p> More on the potential effects of chemical sunscreens can be found in the "The Environmental and Biological Effects of Chemical Sunscreen" article below. </p>
 <br> </br>
<p> To conclude, chemical and physical sunscreens are the two classifications of sunscreens currently in the market. If not directly labeled, you can differentiate the two types by looking at the "Active Ingredients" list in the back of the product to find either zinc oxide/titanium dioxide, indicating it's a physical sunscreen, or a long list of active ingredients including avobenzone, octinoxate, oxybenzone and others mentioned above to indicate a chemical sunscreen. The primary difference between the two is how they protect the skin from the damaging UV rays. Chemical ingredients absorb into the skin. Then, they absorb UV rays from the sun, convert them to heat, and release them from your body so they can’t damage your skin and cause sunburns. Physical sunscreens, also commonly called mineral sunscreens, sit atop the skin rather than absorbing into it. They create a barrier on the skin’s surface that reflects UV rays to prevent damage and sunburns. </p>

  <br> </br>
  <p>With increasing awareness regarding the risks of sunburn, photoaging, and skin cancer, the use of sunscreens has increased significantly the past 20 years. Concerns have been raised regarding the environmental effects of commonly used organic (chemical sunscreen) filters. Studies have identified these UV filters in almost all water sources around the world and have commented that these filters are not easily removed by common wastewater treatment plant techniques. Specifically oxybenzon is suspected to be a big contributer in coral reef bleaching. These filters have also been identified in various species of fish worldwide, which has possible consequences for the food chain. These fish, as well as other marine species have demonstrated alterations to the reproductive and endocrine systems as a result of the presence of those ingredients, which prompted the FDA and further studies to evaluate the effects of those chemicals on the human body. </p>
  <br> </br>
  <p>In contrast, mineral sunscreen never enters through intact skin, so as of current research, they have no adverse effects on humans or the environment, and arguably give better broad spectrum protection, according to dermatologists. Especially during pregnancy and while breastfeeding, doctors don't recommend using chemical sunscreen, as when it enters the bloodstream it can directly affect the content of breast milk as well as the health of the fetus, causing developmental problems and birth defects as well as low birth weights, coronary heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes and others.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <h4> What is happening with chemical sunscreens then?</h4>
  <p> There are currently research studies being done to more conclusively determine the effect of chemical sunscreen on the human body. At the same time, many areas with unique marine life, such as Hawaii, Palau, Key West (Florida), US Virgin Islands, Brazil, and parts of Europe have placed a ban on many, and in some cases all, organic UV filters. The potential endocrine disruptors have become a hot topic with unclear direction. The aim of this page is to provide you with adequate information to be able to make an educated decision when buying sunscreen.</p>

<div class="flexHalf" style="margin-left: 50%; margin-right:10%;">
  <p>If you've already read "The Environmental and Biological Effects of Chemical Sunscreen" article, you're probably thinking "why would anyone wear sunscreen when there's so much unknown and so much potential for damage??" Well, there are plenty of science-based reasons why it is still so important to wear sunscreen everyday. Yes, even in the winter.</p>
<br> </br>
  <p> Our skin works to protect us from powerful UV radiation, and sunscreen protects our skin from damaging UV rays. Even on cloudy days, when indoors, or during the winter, our skin is susceptible to the sun's rays which can lead to skin cancer, discoloration, wrinkles, and other dermatological conditions over time. </p>
  <br> </br> 
  <h4> Regular, daily use of sunscreen can reduce your risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma by about 40 percent, and lower your melanoma risk by 50 percent, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.</h4>
  <br> </br> 
  <h4> Applying sunscreen everyday, and reapplying every 2 hours (no matter the SPF) keeps you protected from UVA and UVB rays.</h4>
  <br> </br>
  <p> Sunscreen reduces your overall UV exposure and lowers your risk of skin cancer and sun damage. UVA and UVB rays are capable of changing and breaking our DNA, which codes for production of proteins, specifically those such as collagen and elastin that are important for strengthening the skin that are damaged with aging.</p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">Sunscreen and Vitamin D: Myths vs. Facts</button>
<div class="content">
<div class="flexHalf" style="margin-left: 5%; margin-right:35%;">
  <p>Vitamin D is a vitamin that has a variety of important roles in our body such as maintaining calcium levels, osteoporeosis prevention, and studies additionally suggest that vitamin D aids in cancer and cardiac diseases prevention.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <h4> How is Vitamin D produced? </h4>
  <p> Vitamin D is naturally produced in our skin cells when we are exposed to UVB rays. When UVB rays hit the epidermis, the top layer of the skin, vitamin D3 is formed by  a 7-dehydrocholesterol (7-DHC) molecule.This molecule absorbs rays in 270-300nm wavelength. Vitamin D production peaks in the 295-297nm wavelength range. The intensity and length of the UVB rays coming in contact with our skin determine how much Vitamin D will be produced.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <p> For most of us, we get enough Vitamin D from occasional, unfrequent exposure to the sun. When the UV index is 3 or higher (during the summer season), most people maintain vitamin D levels just by exposure of a couple of minutes to the sun, not even every day. Additionally, our bodies have a mechanism to prevent over-vitamin D production (vitamin D toxicity), so prolonged exposure to the sun will not increase vitamin D, but rather cause it to break down.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <h4> Does sunscreen prevent vitamin D absorption? </h4>
  <p> Sunscreen reduces the amounts of UVB rays that enter the skin. A common misconception is that due to the decrease in UVB rays, there will be a decrease in Vitamin D production.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <p> However, a study from 2009 found that sunscreen has negligible effect on vitamin D deficency. The reason for that is that most people do not apply enough sunscreen. Even those that reapply every 2 hours at the adequate amounts have spots that are typically missed, such as the scalp to between the fingers, and those spots absorb enough UV rays to have the recommended amounts of Vitamin D.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <p> An additional, and more recent study conducted in Brazil in 2019 tested the effect of sunscreen with SPF30 on vitamin D concentrations of healthy adults. The study tested 95 healthy adults with a variety of skin tones. They were divided into 3 groups: </p>
  <p> Group #1: 64 individuals, used SPF30 on the face, neck, and chest during sun exposure.</p>
  <p> Group #2: 10 individuals, no use of any sunscreen during sun exposure.</p>
  <p> Group #3: 21 individuals, were not exposed to the sun at all. </p>
  <p> The experiment took 24 hours, with a UV index of 5 and average temperature of 23 degrees celsius. Groups 1 and 2, exposed to the sun, were exposed for 14-18 minutes, and were tested for vitamin D levels twice: in the beginning and end of the experiment to approximate vitamin D absorption through sun exposure.</p>
  <p> The results of the experiment showed that there was no difference in vitamin D absorption between groups 1 and 2, but group 3 had a statistically significant difference compared to the other 2 groups. The study concluded that sun exposure wil SPF50 provides similar absorption of vitamin D compared to exposure without sun protection.</p>
  <br> </br>
<h4> So how can you get vitamin D without sun exposure?</h4>
<p> If you live in a climate with long winters, you might want to find additional sources of vitamin D that do not involve putting your health at risk under the sun. There is food that is rich in vitamin D, such as mushrooms, fish, liver, butter, egg, and cheese. Vitamin D pills are also available with a doctor recommendation. Fun Fact: In Britain, due to high cloud coverage and low UVB, the national health association recommends that everyone considers taking a daily vitamin D supplement during the winter. </p>

<button type="button" class="collapsible">SPF: What do those 3 letters mean? </button>
<div class="content">
  <img class="center" src="assets/SS11.jpg" alt="spf graph showing a non-linear curve that flattens out at close to 99% efficency as the spf gets higher" height=90%>
  <br> </br>
  <p>SPF stands for Sun Protection Factor.The number tells you how long the sun’s UVB rays would take to redden your skin if you apply the sunscreen exactly as directed compared with the amount of time without sunscreen. So, if you use an SPF 30 product properly, it would take you 30 times longer to burn than if you used no sunscreen. </p>
  <br> </br>
  <p> An SPF30 allows about 3% of UVB rays to hit your skin, while an SPF50 allows about 2% of those rays through. This small difference translates to 50% more UV radiation onto the skin. Based on this fact, people often look for the product with the highest SPF, to get more protection. However, these products offer a false sense of security: based on the SPF graph above, past SPF50 the curve flattens out almost completely, showing almost no difference between any SPF higher than 50.</p>
  <br> </br>
  <h4> The general recommendation is to use SPF 30 or above, especially during the summer months and while engaging in activities in direct sunlight. Regardless of the SPF though, it is still recommended to reapply every 2 hours and when swimming or exercising. </h4>
