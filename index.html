    <h4 class="intro"> Sunscreen, also known as sunblock or sun cream, is a photoprotective topical product for the skin that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's ultraviolet radiation and thus helps protect against sunburn and most importantly prevent skin cancer.</h4>
    <br> </br>
    <h3 class="intro">So what's the deal with that?</h3>
    <br> </br>
    <h4 class="intro"> With so much misinformation around the topic, this website aims at making true, science-based information more accessible. Here you can find articles, summaries, and diagrams covering the different types of sunscreen, common misconceptions, the harmful effect of chemical sunscreen, the importance of using sun protection year-round, the meaning of spf on sunscreen containers, and so much more readily available information. Visit the "Articles" page to explore the topic in-depth, or continue scrolling on the main page for a short overview! </h4>

  <p> Sunscreen. The #1 preventative measure for skin cancers, aging, and discoloration. The past few years have been characterized with an increase in sunscreen awareness among the general public. With that, there has also been an increase in research and conflicting research that leads to confusion and misconceptions. In the articles page, you can find different sections that organize information about the topic of sunscreen. </p>
  <br> </br> 
  <p> There are 2 types of sunscreen: physical sunscreen, also known as mineral or anorganic sunscreen, and chemical sunscreen, also known as organic sunscreen. The difference between the 2 is the mechanism of protection: mineral sunscreen protects skin cells by creating a physical layer that shields UV rays from entering the skin, while chemical sunscreen protects skin cells by entering the skin, absorbing UV rays, and converting it into heat that is released from the body. Recently, studies have found that the ingredients used in chemical sunscreen damage marine life (coral bleaching, endocrine disruption in fish, etc.) and suspicion about the safety of these products have been raised as their impact on the human body is unknown. Still, sunscreen remains particularly important with global warming, and wearing SPF30 or higher daily, while reapplying every 2 hours is recommended by every dermatologist. </p>
